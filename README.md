# dawgbytescampsy
A small processing js project created as part of UW's dawgbytes camp
It is incomplete, and I don't really plan on completing it because I have no idea what the website is about.
The main thing is just the animation, so don't bother about the other stuff - they're just decoration basically.
This was created in the Summer of 2017. Not sure exactly when, and I'm too lazy to check.
